				<p>
					SourceMoz (pronounced ‘sɔrs-mɒs’/‘sohrs-mahz’) is a simple and functional
					search engine that does not save, track or share your IP address or usage
					activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most major search engines collect user information that is automatically sent
					to them by your computer including IP addresses, user agents, the time/date
					of the search and of course, what it is you searched for.  Since a search engine
					is not required by law to collect or save any personal or usage information, at
					SourceMoz we choose not to do so.

					<!--style="color: #aaaaaa;">The major search engines have become infamous for collecting and storing various&nbsp;types of user information that is automatically sent to them by your computer&nbsp;including IP addresses, user agents, the time/date of the search and of course, what&nbsp;it is you searched for. &nbsp;What they do with this information is a serious concern&nbsp;especially when considering that it can be released to third parties including&nbsp;private businesses, non-governmental organizations, law enforcement agencies and&nbsp;even the general public.</span><br><br><span-->
